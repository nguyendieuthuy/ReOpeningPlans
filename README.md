# Summary
This repository contains data of reopening dates by US States. This dataset is collected by Kosali Simon and Thuy Nguyen, with assistance from Elizabeth McAvoy and Ailish Cornwell. 

We collected and coded data from the New York Times descriptions of each state's closure policies, and verified through internet searches of a given state's reopening policy. As we did not find any other source as yet that creates a spreadsheet with these details as well as web citation, we share the spreadsheet where we code these laws to provide it to researchers. 

# Inquiries
If you have technical questions about the data collection, please contact Thuy Nguyen at thdnguye[at]iu[dot]edu or Kosali Simon at simonkos[at]iu[dot]edu.
